            <h3>CareCan Blog</h3>
            <p.bold>Coming Soon…Vent Your Complaints Here</p>

            <p><a href="#">How many times have you complained about something? This is a great site to vent and a place to share your complaints. We do believe problems are to be addressed and not dismissed, denied or avoided. Recognizing and naming a problem are necessary first steps. It is the starting place of a process. A process that empowers people who have concerns to plan, act, and impact. CareCan exists to equip you to make your mark and this world a better place. Soon we will have a platform here on our site, where you are free to vent about your biggest complaints. Over time we will organize the complaints and create communities where your complaints may be effectively addressed.
            </a></p>
            <p.bold>Shifting Complaints to Concerns</p>
            <p><a href="#">Once you’ve had a chance to vent. We’ll encourage you to evaluate and prioritize your concerns. Sometimes it is enough to vent; other times you may feel called to do more. At CareCan we have concepts and creative tools that will equip you to evaluate your willingness to address your concerns head on. Chances are, if it bothers you, someone else is frustrated by it too.
            </a></p>
            <p.bold>Concerns to Creative Solutions</p>
            <p><a href="#">Our team consists of people like you. People who started off seeing problems, and then realized unmet market needs. We felt called to address our prioritized concerns. If it keeps you up at night, it’s quite possible you are being called to alleviate the burden. We are eager to share our experiences and empower you to make your mark and be the change you’d like to see in your community and our world.
            </a></p>
            <p.bold>Creative Concepts, Capital and Commercialization</p>
              <p><a href="#">At CareCan we have created and implemented simple solutions that have solved complex problems. It’s a long hard road to get from crayon concepts to commercialization. We’ve been there and done that. We have the lessons learned and  battle scars to prove it. Even so, we will do it all over if duty calls. It is our hope that the processes and programs we created to “get the job done” can be utilized by others to do the same. If you care, you can. Godspeed!</a></p>
